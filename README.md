# Design and Analysis of Algorithms

Algorithms implemented in Python for the course Design and Analysis of Algorithms Part 1 on Coursera from Stanford.

# Week 1 - Merge-Sort
Compute the number of inversion in a text file containing integers 1 - 100,000 

# Week 2 - QuickSort
Compute the number of comparison in QuickSort with different partitioning strategies

# Week 3 - Karger's algorithm
Compute the size of the minimum cut of a given graph using the Karger's algorithm

# Week 4 - Kosaraju's algorithm
Find the strongly connected components (strictly speaking, the sizes only) of a graph with 800k nodes.
This was implemented in the recursive and in the iterative way

# Week 5 - Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm
Run Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm on a graph, using 1 (the first vertex) as the source vertex, and compute the shortest-path distances between 1 and every other vertex of the graph. If there is no path between a vertex v and vertex 1, we'll define the shortest-path distance between 1 and v to be 1000000.
