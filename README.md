# Design and Analysis of Algorithms

Algorithms implemented in Python for the course Design and Analysis of Algorithms Part 1 on Coursera from Stanford.

# Week 1 - Merge-Sort
Compute the number of inversion in a text file containing integers 1 - 100,000 

# Week 2 - QuickSort
Compute the number of comparison in QuickSort with different partitioning strategies

# Week 3 - Karger's algorithm
Compute the size of the minimum cut of a given graph using the Karger's algorithm

# Week 4 - Kosaraju's algorithm
Find the strongly connected components (strictly speaking, the sizes only) of a graph with 800k nodes.
